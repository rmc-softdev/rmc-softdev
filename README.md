- 🔭 I'm a React specialist. Also one line-height px means quite a lot to me.
- 👯 IAwesome colleagues made me a better person. And also a rather restlessly excited developer.
- 🥅 The first word that comes up in my mind when I think of 2021 is: gratitude.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know how to solve some weird, movie-like physics and I love playing games!


### Favorite stack as of now, really loving it so far:
