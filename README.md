### Hey there, I'm Raf, aka [rmcsoftdev][website] 👨‍💻. Let's [connect][linkedin].

- 🔭 I'm a React specialist (way before its hype). Also one line-height px means quite a lot to me.
- 👯 Awesome colleagues made me a better person. And also a rather restlessly excited developer.
- 🥅 The first word that comes up in my mind when I think of 2022 is: gratitude.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to know how to solve some weird, movie-like physics and I love playing games!
