### I'm Rafa and I like to build awesome things [rmcsoftdev][website] 👨‍💻

##

- 🔭 I'm a React specialist. Also one line-height px means quite a lot to me.
- 👯 IAwesome colleagues made me a better person. And also a rather restlessly excited developer.
- 🥅 The only word that comes up in my mind when I think of 2021 is: gratitude. :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know how to solve some weird, movie-like physics and I love playing games!
